# Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are a subset of software design patterns concerned with assigning responsibilities among objects and how these objects communicate and interact. They help to manage complex flows and interactions in software systems, creating a more modular, scalable, and maintainable system.

By using the Behavioral Design Patterns, you can:

* enable flexible and efficient object interaction
* reduce tight coupling between classes for better maintainability
* simplify complex communication and collaboration between objects
* allow dynamic modification of behavior at runtime
